This project prompted students to create a functional booking application which allowed the user to book flights, accommodations, and more with javaswing UI. 

When opening the application, saved datafiles will automatically update the current arraylists and there is a save option for the packages and more. 

The code has been modified to help with GUI readability, although it includes a console version as well. If you wanted only the console version, you'd need to change the printout layouts a tiny bit.
